Level Order TRaversal
1.Create a queue of node pointers 
  TreeNode *q[100];// queue node pointers
2. Take 2 variables front and rear
    set front=0
    set rear=1
3. Insert root node at 0 index in the queue 
   q[0]=root;
4.As long queue is not empty(front!=rear)
    1.delete the node at front(dequeue) and print its value
    2.Increment front(front++)
    3.If at all there are children for deleted node append them (enqueue)
    to the queue at rear position
