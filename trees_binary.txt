Conversion of an array to a binary tree 
Step1:
        Take a queue of TreeNode pointers 
            TreeNode *q[100];
Step2:
        Take 2 variables front and rear and set them 0
Step3:
        Create a new tree node with the firstt
        value in the array  and put it in the queue
Step4:
        Take a variable i to run on the  array 
        and set it to 0
Step5:
    Run a infinite loop
        check if 2*i+1>=n or 2*i+2>=n
            if so break
        if 2*i+1<n
             then create a node with the value 
             at 2*i+1<n index and add it to queue
             connet the created node at the LEFT
             part of front node in the queue
        if 2*i+2<n 
             then create a node with the value 
             at 2*i+1<n index and add it to queue
             connet the created node at the RIGHT
             part of front node in the queue
 move front towards right(front++)
 move i towards right in the array(i++)
