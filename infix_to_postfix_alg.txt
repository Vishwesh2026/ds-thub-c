Step1: Take a stack and a Postfix string.
Step2: Run a loop through Infix string.
Step3:If the character is an OPERAND add it to the postfix string.
      Else
      If Stack is empty push the operator into the Stack.
       Else 
       Run a loop till
       top!= -1 && prec(infix[i]) <= prec(stack[top])
       pop the elment from the stack and add it to postfix string.
      After the end of the loop
       push infix[i] into the Stack 
Step4: 
    Add the remaining operators in the stack to postfix string.
